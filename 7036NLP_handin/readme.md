## Usage Instructions

First, run the **`run_me_first.py`** file. This script will sequentially execute the following five Python scripts:  
**`information_acquiring.py`**, **`download_annual_report.py`**, **`html2txt.py`**, **`split&stopwords.py`**, and **`train.py`**.
After execution, the final sentiment analysis results will be output to **`financial_sentiment_result_final.csv`**.

Next, we use **`sentiment_and_return.ipynb`** to analyze the relationship between stock data and sentiment scores. The final analysis results and visualizations are saved within this file.
